CS 521 Project
Topic: Predicting Housing Prices (Linear Regression)
Names: Wanzhen Li, Tomas Hornicek

In our project we will explore a housing dataset containning data about houses that were sold in the previous years. Based upon the dataset we will use linear/logistic regression to predict house prices for the coming years. The data set we choose to explore is very large, therefore the first step we will take would be to dumify the data, meaning that we will take out all the rows that contain null data. We realise that this will that the opportunity cost of this action is that our project analysis will lose some accuracy, however by doing this we will make our data easy to manupilate with.(Is there a better way to do it Prof Burstein?). After we have dummified the data we have to pick out the variables that affect the housing prices the most. In order to do that we will use the correlation coefficient measuring how closely each variable is correlated to the Sale Price. We then decided to analyze the data which have the coorelation coefficient higher than |+-0.3| and built a new data frame from them. Using the newly created data frame we will compare and contrast the variables to predict how different variables affect the Sale Price and how the Sale Price will look based off those variables.  We are sure that we will uncover very interesting discoveries and predictive analytics. We are really excited to move forward with this projectÔºÅ
