Project Option: Predicting Housing Prices (Linear Regression)
Comment: We intend to find historical data about house prices in a certain borough (such as orange county of Los Angeles) for the past four years and use linear/logistic regression to predict house prices for the next year. Housing prices in big cities are more sensitive to social environments, such as the epidemic and inflation. So we may have very interesting discoveries and predictive analytics. We feel really excited to do itÔºÅ
